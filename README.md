# moVi-labs

[V-labs](https://v-labs.fr) onboarding project.

Highly inspired by the [Movie App design of Emre Secer](https://dribbble.com/shots/7158704-Movie-App/attachments/161831?mode=media)

### Todo:

- [x] ~~Add popularity bar to the ActorView~~ (implemented but not used because unuseful to the user)
- [ ] Change "vote count" from the MovieDetailView to a more useful data
- [ ] Add three points ("...") to the truncated movie overview text at ActorView
- [ ] Use v-labs color scheme
- [ ] Add a "About this app" tab

**Curent problems**

- [ ] DetailView Title text doesn't scale backwards if text is too long
- [ ] TabBar shadow color doesn't adapt in dark mode
- [ ] Transitioning to a view briefly show the mock data
- [ ] Storyline section in detail view isn't correctly align (leading) if text is too short (see "Peninsula")
- [ ] Ugly search text field isn't coherent with the UI
- [ ] Some movies doesn't show the rating correctly (see "The Crimes That Bind")
- [ ] Some ActorViews show a line between the gradiented image and the body of the view  (see "The SpongeBob Movie" > 3rd actor (Carolyn Lawrence)
- [ ] Some placeholders in the cast carousel (detail view) aren't shown (see "Santana", 7th item)
